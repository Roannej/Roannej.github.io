  <p><strong>OBJECTIVE&colon;CSS Learn Secondary Navigation</strong>
  <br><strong>FreshDeals Blueberries</strong>
  <em>The currently selected product is “Organic Blueberries”. If you landed on this page, you may have some questions.

  By doing so, users will have a better feeling for what the site provides and the optional attributes of the product they are purchasing.
  We are focused on the layout of this page and will be implementing the breadcrumbs via HTML and CSS. The links to the breadcrumbs will not function.</em>

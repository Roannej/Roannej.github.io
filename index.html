  <p><strong>OBJECTIVE&colon;Layout with Flexbox - Responsive Websites</strong>
  <br><strong>Tea Cozy</strong>
  <em>In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.
  We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a 
    web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as 
    a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the 
    basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.</em>

  <p><strong>OBJECTIVE&colon;CSS Learn Secondary Navigation</strong>
  <br><strong>FreshDeals Blueberries</strong>
  <em>The currently selected product is “Organic Blueberries”. If you landed on this page, you may have some questions.
  Can I buy anything besides blueberries?
  Is everything on this site organic or can I buy conventional produce?
  Does this site offer non-produce items?
  By adding breadcrumbs to this site, you will be adding a UI element that hints to some of the questions above. 
  By doing so, users will have a better feeling for what the site provides and the optional attributes of the product they are purchasing.
  We are focused on the layout of this page and will be implementing the breadcrumbs via HTML and CSS. The links to the breadcrumbs will not function.</em>

  <p><strong>OBJECTIVE&colon;CSS Learn Links &amp; Buttons</strong>
  <br><strong>The Summit</strong>
  <em>Time to put some navigation design knowledge to the test! Your goal is to improve the user experience of this ski lodge landing page. 
    Currently, none of the clickable elements are very clear or offer good visual feedback to users.
The exact implementation and styling will be up to you; take the opportunity to be creative in your designs! 
    Keep in mind that slick styling is cool, but it is just as important to clearly demonstrate to users how to interact with the site. 
    We’ll provide some hints along the way if you’re stuck.</em>
